Circuitron is a racing game created for CPSC 585 by Daniel, Taylor, Matt and Sebastien.  Inspired by games like Tron and F-Zero, prepare yourself for an exciting circuit race with a track that becomes more-and-more hectic as the game goes on.  You'll need to outmaneuver, outwit and outplay your oppenents to become the champion in this thrilling high-speed race.

### How to play:

In order to win, you'll need to complete 3 laps around the circuit.  Simple right?

Well, as each bike drives, it leaves behind a Tron-esque trail of walls.  Be careful!  If you hit one of these walls, or fall of the stage, you'll take damage.  Take enough damage and you're out.

But don't worry, your bike is equipped with some tools to help along the way:

- Use the **Bike Omnidirectional Booster** (BOB) to propel yourself upwards or to the sides for a quick dodge.
- Use the **Wall Application Device** (WAD) to create large walls behind you and make your opponents blunder.
- Use the **Forward Ranged Aggression Gun** (FRAG) to destroy any walls that get in your way.

Now don't go using all these at once.  Everytime you use an ability, it'll cost you some health.  A small price to pay.

Falling behind?  Try driving beside the walls.  This risky slipstreaming maneuver will get you a bit of speed, and some health back too.

### Well what are you waiting for?

Get out there and start driving.  You've got a race to win!
